# ATM-Project
###ATM Project in Java  

This project is a simulation of an **ATM (Automated Teller Machine)** system implemented in Java. It demonstrates my knowledge of **Core Java concepts**, including the **Collection Framework**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, and user interaction with a menu-driven interface.

## Project Structure  

The project consists of the following files:  

- **`Account.java`**  
  Handles account-related data and operations such as balance inquiry, deposits, and withdrawals.  

- **`Atm.java`**  
  Serves as the main driver class for the application, initializing and running the ATM system.  

- **`OptionMenu.java`**  
  Provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the ATM, enabling the following features:  
  - **Balance Inquiry**  
  - **Cash Withdrawal**  
  - **Cash Deposit**  
  - **Exit**  

- **`README.md`**  
  Contains details about the project, its structure, and usage.
